# RSA Image Encryption System  

## Project Overview  
This project is a **Flask-based web application** that enables users to securely share images using **RSA encryption**. It supports real-time communication using **Flask-SocketIO**, allowing multiple users to participate in an encrypted image transfer system.

---

## Features  
âœ… **Channel-based communication** â€“ Users can create and join unique channels.  
âœ… **Image encryption with RSA** â€“ Securely encrypt and decrypt images.  
âœ… **Multi-user support** â€“ Roles include sender, interceptor, and receiver.  
âœ… **Flask-SocketIO integration** â€“ Real-time notifications when images are uploaded.  
âœ… **Automatic image cleanup** â€“ Removes old images upon new session creation.

## Setup Instructions  

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kaushik5138008/rsa-image-encryption.git
cd rsa-image-encryption
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed. Then, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Flask Application**  
```sh
python app.py
```
or with Flaskâ€™s development server:
```sh
flask run
```

### **4. Access the Web App**  
Open your browser and go to:  
ðŸ‘‰ **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**

## Usage  
### **Roles in the System**
- **Sender** â€“ Uploads images and encrypts them before sending.  
- **Interceptor** â€“ Views the encrypted images.  
- **Receiver** â€“ Decrypts images and retrieves the original version.  

### **How It Works**
1. **Create a Channel** â€“ Generates a unique key for secure communication.  
2. **Join a Channel** â€“ Other users enter the key to access the same session.  
3. **Upload an Image** â€“ The sender selects images to encrypt using RSA.  
4. **Intercept Encrypted Image** â€“ The interceptor can view the encrypted version.  
5. **Receive & Decrypt** â€“ The receiver gets the decrypted image.

## Flask Routes  
| Route | Method | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | `GET` | Homepage |
| `/create_channel` | `POST` | Creates a new encrypted channel |
| `/join_channel` | `POST` | Joins an existing channel |
| `/choose_role/<channel_key>` | `POST` | Selects sender, interceptor, or receiver |
| `/sender/<channel_key>` | `POST` | Uploads and encrypts images |
| `/interceptor/<channel_key>` | `GET` | Displays encrypted images |
| `/receiver/<channel_key>` | `GET` | Displays decrypted images |

---

## WebSocket Events  
| Event | Trigger | Action |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `join` | User joins a channel | Adds the user to the WebSocket room |
| `new_image` | Sender uploads an image | Notifies all users in the channel |
| `user_joined` | A user joins a session | Sends a message to all channel members |

---

## Dependencies  
ðŸ“Œ **Flask** â€“ Web framework  
ðŸ“Œ **Flask-SocketIO** â€“ Real-time WebSocket communication  
ðŸ“Œ **Pillow** â€“ Image processing  
ðŸ“Œ **PyCryptodome** â€“ RSA encryption library  

To install:
```sh
pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO Pillow pycryptodome
```

## Security Considerations  
ðŸ”’ **Session-based storage** â€“ Active users are managed using Flask sessions.  
ðŸ”’ **RSA encryption** â€“ Images are secured with asymmetric encryption.  
ðŸ”’ **Automatic cleanup** â€“ Old images are removed to maintain security.
